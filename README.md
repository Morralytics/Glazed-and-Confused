## Description

The project is a user-focused platform built using the MERN-stack single-page application architecture. It utilizes MongoDB as a back end, GraphQL API for data querying and manipulation, and an Express.js and Node.js server to handle server-side operations. The front end is built using React and provides a seamless user interface for easy interaction.
The platform implements user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT), ensuring secure access to user accounts and preventing unauthorized access. With this feature, users can create accounts, log in, and perform actions tailored to their specific permissions. The platform can be customized to suit various business needs, making it a versatile tool for building web applications that require user-focused functionality.
